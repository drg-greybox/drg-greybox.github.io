# 3rd annual DRG workshop, December 2020

<br>

Back in December 2020, the Dynamics Research Group held its 3rd annual workshop on structural dynamics (full information can be found [here](https://lvv.ac.uk/lvv-events/Recordings-3rd-sheffield-workshop-on-structural-dynamics))

On the second day, Lizzy hosted a full day session on physics-informed machine learning, which included a number of great talks from members of the group, as well as the wider community. Check out the presentations from Lizzy and Tim below:

 You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
