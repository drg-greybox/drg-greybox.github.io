### Professor Lizzy Cross

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drg-greybox/drg-greybox.github.io/master/docs/images/lizzy_pic.jpg">

Lizzy Cross is a Professor in the Dynamics Research Group at the University of Sheffield. Before starting her lectureship in 2012, she completed a Bachelors in Mathematics (1st class), and Masters and PhD in Mechanical Engineering. She currently holds an EPRSC Innovation Fellowship on the development of grey-box models for assessing the health of structures in operation (grey-box models combine physics-based models with machine learning technology). Lizzy is a co-director of the Laboratory for Verification and Validation, a state-of-the-art dynamic testing facility

Dr Tim Rogers is a lecturer in the Dynamics Research Group (DRG), part of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Sheffield. He has completed both his MEng in Mechanical Engineering and his PhD at Sheffield, the title of which was "Towards Bayesian System Identification: With Application to SHM of Offshore Structures". His work focusses on application of Machine Learning and Bayesian statistical methods to problems in structural dynamics in particular those within nonlinear system identification and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

### Dr Chandula Wickramarachchi

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drg-greybox/drg-greybox.github.io/master/docs/images/chandy_pic.jpg"> Chandula Wickramarachchi received her EngD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2019. Her EngD focused on automated testing of advanced cutting tool materials. Since 2019, she has been working to implement databases in the context of population-based structural health monitoring to aid with maintenance and monitoring of groups of structures. Additionally, her focus is on using metrics to assess similarity of data collected from structures (using data-based methods) and of structures themselves (utilising graph kernels) to aid the transfer of information across structures to aid population-based structural health monitoring.

### Dr Mate Toth

My research focussed on optimising grinding processes by finding and exploiting as yet unexplored areas of stable, chatter-free operation. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate working on cutting tool life prediction. I use physics-informed machine learning, primarily Gaussian processes and particle filters, to model tool wear progression and estimate remaining useful life. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, meeting new people from around the world, and trying new restaurants.

### Matt Jones

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drg-greybox/drg-greybox.github.io/master/docs/images/matt_pic.jpg"> Hey, I'm Matt and I'm a research associate in the DRG. My general focus is on the application of probabilistic machine learning techniques to problems arising in structural health monitoring, including damage detection and localisation. Recently, I've been interested in constraining machine learnings models with physical knowledge as a way to enhance predictive capabilities; particularly in scenarios where training data is scarce. An example of this includes constraining Gaussian processes with known boundary condition values to learn spatial maps of phenomena arising in SHM. I have an interest in lots of sports including rugby and climbing, which is great when living in Sheffield!

### Gloria (Weijiang) Lin

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drg-greybox/drg-greybox.github.io/master/docs/images/gloria_pic.jpg">  Hi, I am Gloria (Weijiang) Lin, a PhD student based in Sheffield. I create Gaussian process-based, spatio-temporal models for applications in structural health monitoring (SHM). I have demonstrated how a spatio-temporal model can be used to (1) [study environmental and operational variations in population-based SHM](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47717-2_31), and (2) [as a performance indicator for wind turbine farms](http://past.isma-isaac.be/downloads/isma2020/abstracts/AbstractPage_ID398.pdf). My recent interest is in physics-informed methods for spatio-temporal modelling.

### Dan Pitchforth

<img style="float: right; padding-left:10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drg-greybox/drg-greybox.github.io/master/docs/images/dan_pic.jpg"> I joined the Dynamics Research Group in 2019 as a PhD student on the project “Developing grey-box models for structural dynamics: optimising the balance between physics and data-based learning”. My research interests focus on the combination of computationally inexpensive physics-based models, that may be more easily validated, with probabilistic data-based approaches. Recent work has focussed on the combination of Morison’s equation, an empirical wave loading solution, with Gaussian process NARX models to improve the performance of wave loading prediction on offshore structures. Outside work I enjoy cycling in the Peak district and playing underwater hockey – yes it’s a real sport!
