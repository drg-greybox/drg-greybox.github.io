### Professor Lizzy Cross

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="lizzy_pic.jpg"> Lizzy Cross is a Professor in the Dynamics Research Group at the University of Sheffield. Before starting her lectureship in 2012, she completed a Bachelors in Mathematics (1st class), and Masters and PhD in Mechanical Engineering. She currently holds an EPRSC Innovation Fellowship on the development of grey-box models for assessing the health of structures in operation (grey-box models combine physics-based models with machine learning technology). Lizzy is a co-director of the Laboratory for Verification and Validation, a state-of-the-art dynamic testing facility

### Dr Tim Rogers

<img style="float: right; padding-left:10px" src="tim_pic.jpg">

Tim is a lecturer in the Dynamics Research Group (DRG), part of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Sheffield. He has completed both his MEng in Mechanical Engineering and his PhD at Sheffield, the title of which was "Towards Bayesian System Identification: With Application to SHM of Offshore Structures". His work focusses on application of Machine Learning and Bayesian statistical methods to problems in structural dynamics in particular those within nonlinear system identification and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

### Dr Chandula Wickramarachchi

<img style="float: right; padding-left:10px" src="chandy_pic.jpg"> Chandula Wickramarachchi received her EngD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sheffield in 2019. Her EngD focused on automated testing of advanced cutting tool materials. Since 2019, she has been working to implement databases in the context of population-based structural health monitoring to aid with maintenance and monitoring of groups of structures. Additionally, her focus is on using metrics to assess similarity of data collected from structures (using data-based methods) and of structures themselves (utilising graph kernels) to aid the transfer of information across structures to aid population-based structural health monitoring.

### Dr Sikai Zhang

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="sikai_pic.jpg"> Sikai Zhang is currently a postdoctorate research associate in the Dynamics Research Group at the University of Sheffield. His research is about Gaussian-process-based grey-box modelling for structural health monitoring (SHM). By combining the advantage of physics-driven (white-box) and data-driven (black-box) models, the work can improve model prediction accuracy in extrapolation where the data coverage is low. The work has been successfully applied in the power curve prediction and Tamar bridge deflection prediction.

### Matt Jones

<img style="float: left; padding-right:10px" src="matt_pic.jpg"> Matt is a final year PhD student in the DRG. His general focus is on the application of probabilistic machine learning techniques to problems arising in structural health monitoring, including damage detection and localisation. Recently, he has been interested in constraining machine learnings models with physical knowledge as a way to enhance predictive capabilities; particularly in scenarios where training data is scarce. An example of this includes constraining Gaussian processes with known boundary condition values to learn spatial maps of phenomena arising in SHM.

### Gloria (Weijiang) Lin

<img style="float: right; padding-left:10px" src="gloria_pic.jpg">  Hi, I am Gloria (Weijiang) Lin, a PhD student based in Sheffield. I create Gaussian process-based, spatio-temporal models for applications in structural health monitoring (SHM). I have demonstrated how a spatio-temporal model can be used to (1) [study environmental and operational variations in population-based SHM](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47717-2_31), and (2) [as a performance indicator for wind turbine farms](http://past.isma-isaac.be/downloads/isma2020/abstracts/AbstractPage_ID398.pdf). My recent interest is in physics-informed methods for spatio-temporal modelling.
