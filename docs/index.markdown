Led by Professor Elizabeth Cross of the Dynamics Research Group, University of Sheffield, a package of work is on-going for developing grey-box models for problems arising in structural health monitoring (SHM). The concept of grey-box modelling is relatively straight forward - if one considers an entirely physics-based model as a white-box model, and a purely data-driven machine learning as a black box, then grey-box is a combination of the two approaches. The overall objective is to enhance traditional machine learning techniques with physical insight into a system, increasing the inference capabilities of our models. The aim of this website is to provide a central hub for the research of the group, including the latest papers, example code, and other useful material relating to grey-box SHM.
